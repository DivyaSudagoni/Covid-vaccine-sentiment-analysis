# COVID Vaccine Sentiment Analysis

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on COVID vaccine-related data by collecting tweets. The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle.

## Preprocessing Steps

The following preprocessing steps were applied to the dataset:

- Converting the text to lowercase.
- Removing URLs from the text.
- Removing punctuation marks.
- Removing single characters and extra spaces.
- Removing numbers.
- Removing stop words.
- Removing emojis.
- Tokenization of the text.
- Stemming of the words.

## Sentiment Analysis Algorithms

The sentiment analysis was performed using the following algorithms:

- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Naive Bayes
- Random Forest
- Logistic Regression
